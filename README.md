## Summary
The aim of this project is to calibrate the daily yield curves based on the benchmark
bonds of the Australian market for the month of December 2018. The yield curve will
be generated using the non parametric Cubic Spline Method and the parametric Nelson
Siegel Method for each day throughout the month based on the daily reference data of
the "Constant Maturity Treasury Rates" or CMTs sourced from Bloomberg(BBG).
